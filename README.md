# sonar-FWI

This project aims to develop a simulation environment for the exploration of
river beds using sonar signals to solve the arising full-waveform inversion
(FWI) problem.

## Tasks

 [ ] Creating snapshots and gifs of the signal propagation.
 [ ] Testing with different physical mesh sizes.
 [ ] Creating a demo for the inversion problem
 [ ] Cehcking literature for the phzsical parameters of the signals used in sonars.
